===============Final Project Log===============
This is our final project for tiger.
We choose the topic about achieving a more powerful miniJava.
This is a very open topic,we can do whatever we want,such as add more operators,more 
keywords,interface,exception and so on.
Be active and enjoy it !

1. add 'final' into tiger,mainly include 3 cases : final in class ,final in variable
   and final in argument, final in method is not included.Besides,we add an new error 
   type named "NotInitial" which is not referred before.
   Adding new words to tiger seems easy to implement,but it is rather complex in some
   cases , so be careful enough !
